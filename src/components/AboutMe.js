    <h3 class="myself">Hi. My name is Nylce Joy Grejarte and I live in the City of Smiles. After I graduated as an IT, I worked in different banks as a bank teller. 
I realized that it was irrelevant to my profession and I'm not happy. Currently working as a Freelance Graphic Design. I am a person who not giving up, even I have depression, trauma, thinking about my career and failures in my life.
I'm not ashamed to tell that because everyone of us experience that.
I am kind of person direct to the point. I am an ARIES I have a strong personality, passionate, and motivated.
 There are many things I like to do, I like to explore, I like to read poems, I like chasing sunsets. I like going to gallery to see arts. I like music and also I love to sing. 
I love art and making design. I love watching movies when I have a free time. I love coffee, explore different coffee shops, and taste and judge the coffee (lol). I want to have a coffee shop that's my dream business, maybe someday.
<br/>One thing about me I am K-pop Fangirl for almost 8 years and huge fan of GOT7. Being a K-pop fan has become my escape from sadness, and problems that are unsolved. Hearing their music, energizes and motivates me.
 If you enjoy it and feel safe, relaxed, and happy, just do it as long as you are not aggrieving others.
Remember, that music doesn't have language it is just the rhythm and the emotion that these idols used while singing, and that is the one that connects each fan to each other and understands
and loves their idols more and supports them as much as they can.
<br/>I want to learn Java and Python, or other high demand in IT industry. As long I learn and know more about in programming and IT industry. </h3>
